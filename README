this is works ok (torsocks git push - also) on 3 march 2020

don't forget to create openssl cert inside ./tls directory:

openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365

my gitea's app.ini settings, I don't have time to figure out all neceties, but SSH_PORT = 22 IMO is most important:
---------------------------------
[server]
APP_DATA_PATH    = /data/gitea
SSH_DOMAIN       = somethingsomethin00.onion
HTTP_PORT        = 3000
ROOT_URL         = https://somethingsomethin00.onion/
DISABLE_SSH      = false
SSH_PORT         = 22
LFS_START_SERVER = true
LFS_CONTENT_PATH = /data/git/lfs
DOMAIN           = somethingsomethin00.onion
LFS_JWT_SECRET   = somethingsomethin
OFFLINE_MODE     = false
---------------------------------

use `./docker-compose.sh up` to up service
use `./docker-compose.sh down` to down service

= settings to make `go get` and `git` work with tor =

1. go have to be configured to work over tor's socks5: 

for this, you can export all_proxy='socks5://127.0.0.1:9050' and
make http_proxy=all_proxy.

note: go doesn't support 'socks5h' scheme, and it's enogh 'socks5' scheme to
resolve .onion domain names.

also, you can prepair script to run go commands:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

export all_proxy="socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"
export http_proxy=$all_proxy
export https_proxy=$all_proxy

"$@"
```

save it for instance as `~/if/soxy` and run go command like so: 
~/if/soxy go get 'someonion.onion/project/package'

2. git also have to be configured to be able to resolve .onion names and connect 
to hidden service

part of .gitconfig in $home directory. 
(NOTE: this may be configured, instead, localy to repository using 
       `git config --local`)
(NOTE: note 'socks5h' in proxy configuration: it makes git to resolve DN via TOR)
```
[http "https://*.onion"]
	sslVerify = false
	proxy = "socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050"

```

3. since newsware_server and newsware_server_utils are private, and go get
forces git to download repositories via http(s) access, it is required to
use http username/password for accessing those repositories.

create file ~/.netrc and add to it line:
machine someonion.onion login yoraccountname password giteaapikeygotfromesettingsmenu
